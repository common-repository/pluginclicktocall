License
	The Ribbit PHP library is released with a BSD license. You are welcome to 
	use it as you see fit both privately and commercially, and to use it to 
	create derivative works provided you follow the licensing terms which 
	can be found in each source file. 
	For further details see http://www.linfo.org/bsdlicense.html

External libraries
	The Ribbit PHP library gratefully uses sypc.php to parse YAML (http://code.google.com/p/spyc/)

Known Dependencies
	Requires PHP 5.2.0 or greater and php_curl extension
	You will also need an application ID, consumer key, shared secret, domain and account Id which can be acquired
	from http://developer.ribbit.com

Notes
	The Ribbit library uses the PHP Session to store OAuth Access tokens.
	It is recommended that you include the line 

		require_once("path_to_ribbit_library/Ribbit.php");

	before you start issuing HTTP response text to avoid session cache
	limiter warnings
	
	The PHP 1.6.0 library uses yaml files for configuration. Your configuration will
	need to be changed if you are upgrading from a previous release.
